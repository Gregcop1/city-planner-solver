<h3>Rules:</h3>
<p>
  The goal of "The city" brain teaser is to place 9 pieces around a frozen one (the floor lamp).
</p>
<p>Rules are quite simple:</p>
<p>
  <strong>-</strong> The floor lamp is placed randomly between 12 possible locations.<br />
  <strong>-</strong> A piece can't be placed above the floor lamp or another piece.
</p>
<p>
  That's it! <strong>Have fun</strong>.
